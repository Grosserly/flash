# [Slightly garlic-scented Flash things](https://grosserly.github.io/flash/)

A site I made to hold and play random `.swf` files I have

## TODO:
* Let you close a SWF in some way other than refreshing the page
* Figure out how to make the Featured slab just a little bit narrower
  - (would be easy if I didn't make all this on a school-issued Chromebook that doesn't let you open Inspect Element)</sub></sup>
* Generate the cards with JS instead of hardcoding each one
  - (was fine before but now it's getting hard to maintain)
